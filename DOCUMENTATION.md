## Overview

AaveDIVAWrapper is a smart contract that acts as a **connector between [DIVA Protocol](https://github.com/divaprotocol/diva-protocol-v1/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md) and [Aave V3](https://discord.com/channels/602826299974877205/636902500041228309/1251248830767169729)**, allowing assets deposited into DIVA Protocol pools to **generate yield by supplying them on Aave V3**. The generated **yield is claimable by the owner** of the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level flow of funds. A technically more detailed flow is provided in the [Main user flows](#main-user-flows) section.

![alt-tag](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2025-01-diva/blob/main/398371105-6a93a0dd-92cc-400a-a5d4-e994170fa6c1.png)

1. User deposits funds (e.g., USDC) into AaveDIVAWrapper.
1. AaveDIVAWrapper supplies these funds to Aave V3 for yield generation.
1. AaveDIVAWrapper creates a new pool or adds liquidity to an existing pool in DIVA Protocol using a wrapped token ([wToken](#wrapped-token-wtoken)) as collateral.
1. The yield generated by Aave V3 is claimable by the owner.

This contract was originally designed for [DIVA Donate](https://www.divadonate.xyz/posts) on Arbitrum, a parametric conditional donations platform, which uses the yield to purchase insurance policies to increase donation payouts beyond the users' initial contributions. However, it can be utilized for any other use case enabled by DIVA Protocol (e.g., prediction markets, structured products, etc.). **Users building on top of DIVA Protocol can deploy their own AaveDIVAWrapper instance and designate themselves as the yield recipient to receive a sustainable revenue stream.**

### Example

To demonstrate the functionality of the AaveDIVAWrapper contract, let's compare two scenarios for Alice's contribution to a [DIVA Donate campaign](https://www.divadonate.xyz/posts/diva-conditional-donations-pastoralists-4): one using direct DIVA Protocol interaction, and another utilizing the AaveDIVAWrapper.

#### Direct DIVA Protocol interaction

- Alice contributes 100 USDC via DIVA Protocol through the DIVA Donate platform.
- When the outcome is reported, 100 USDC either go to the beneficiary (if drought conditions are met) or back to Alice.
- The 100 USDC sits idle in the pool during the campaign's lifetime; **no yield is generated**.

#### Using AaveDIVAWrapper

- Alice contributes 100 USDC via the AaveDIVAWrapper contract through the DIVA Donate platform.
- AaveDIVAWrapper supplies the 100 USDC on Aave which **generates a yield of say 5 USDC during the campaign's lifetime**.
- The owner of AaveDIVAWrapper can use this generated yield in several ways:
  - Cover operational costs of running the platform.
  - Distribute directly to beneficiaries when donation conditions are met.
  - Purchase insurance policies to amplify potential payouts (e.g., using 5 USDC to buy a policy worth 20 USDC).
  - A combination of the above.
- If a donation is triggered, the deposited 100 USDC is paid out to the farmer, along with any additional benefits from the yield usage (e.g., insurance payout or direct yield distribution), thereby increasing the impact of the donation. If no donation is triggered, the contributing user can redeem their 100 USDC from AaveDIVAWrapper (ignoring DIVA fees for simplicity).

### Additional remarks

- **Supported tokens**: The AaveDIVAWrapper accepts any token as collateral that is supported by Aave V3 (e.g., USDC, USDT, etc.) and that was registered in AaveDIVAWrapper by the owner.
- **Fee-on-transfer tokens**: As Aave V3 does not support fee-on-transfer tokens (see [here](https://discord.com/channels/602826299974877205/636902500041228309/1251248830767169729)), the AaveDIVAWrapper contract does not support them either.
- **EIP-712**: As opposed to DIVA Protocol, AaveDIVAWrapper does not support EIP-712 features in the current version. This is a minor limitation though since users can create markets via AaveDIVAWrapper, add liquidity to mint position tokens, and trade these positions on DEXs like [0x protocol](https://0x.org/) that support EIP-712. EIP-712 features are planned for a future release.
- **Aave V3**: The AaveDIVAWrapper contract is built on Aave V3, which is an upgradeable protocol. For simplicity, all references to "Aave" or "Aave V3" in this documentation refer specifically to Aave V3.2.
- **Outcome reporting**: The oracle reporting process remains unchanged from DIVA Protocol's standard process. Data providers / oracles interact directly with DIVA Protocol and not via the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.

## Terminology

### Collateral token

The collateral token is the underlying asset (e.g., USDC, USDT) that users deposit into AaveDIVAWrapper. These tokens must be supported by Aave V3 and registered by the owner in AaveDIVAWrapper before they can be used.

### Position token

The position token is the token representing the **long or short position** in a DIVA Protocol pool, minted by DIVA Protocol when users add liquidity to a pool.

### AToken

ATokens are **interest-bearing** tokens that represent deposits in Aave markets. They have two key characteristics:

1. They are **rebaseable** tokens, meaning their balances automatically increase over time as interest accrues.
2. They maintain a **1:1 peg to the underlying asset** (e.g., 1 aUSDC = 1 USDC).

When AaveDIVAWrapper supplies assets to an Aave market, it receives aTokens in return. The yield earned on the supplied assets is automatically reflected through an increase in the aToken balance in AaveDIVAWrapper's wallet. For more details, see the [Aave documentation](https://docs.aave.com/developers/tokens/atoken#atoken).

### Wrapped token (wToken)

DIVA Protocol requires pool collateralization via non-rebasable ERC20 tokens to ensure stable pool accounting. Since Aave's aTokens are rebasable, they cannot be used directly as collateral in DIVA Protocol. To solve this, the AaveDIVAWrapper contract creates **wrapped versions of collateral tokens (e.g., wUSDC for USDC)**, so-called wTokens, when the owner registers a collateral token via the [`registerCollateralToken`](#registercollateraltoken) function that serve as proxy collateral in DIVA Protocol. These wrapped tokens are **non-rebasable** and **redeemable 1:1 for the underlying collateral token**, making them suitable for use as collateral in DIVA Protocol.

wTokens represent AaveDIVAWrapper's liability of the underlying asset (e.g., USDC) towards long and short token holders, with the total **wToken supply reflecting the contract's total liability**. Only the AaveDIVAWrapper contract has the authority to mint and burn wTokens.

While short and long tokens are collateralized with wTokens, they can be priced in the underlying asset (e.g., USDC) on DEXs like [0x protocol](https://0x.org/) due to 1:1 redemption guarantee for the underlying asset. User's that redeem short or long tokens directly from DIVA Protocol for wTokens can always convert them into the underlying asset using AaveDIVAWrapper's [`redeemWToken`](#redeemwtoken) function.

The wToken address associated with a collateral token such as USDC or USDT can be retrieved via the [`getWToken`](#getwtoken) function.

### Yield

When an asset like USDC is supplied to Aave, yield accrues as an increase in the AaveDIVAWrapper contract's aUSDC balance. The aUSDC amount in excess of the total wUSDC supply is the generated yield, claimable by the AaveDIVAWrapper contract's owner via the [`claimYield`](#claimyield) function.

## Contract overview

The main contracts are:

- **IAaveDIVAWrapper**: Interface for the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
- **AaveDIVAWrapperCore**: An abstract contract that inherits from `IAaveDIVAWrapper` and implements the core functions of the AaveDIVAWrapper contract as internal functions.
- **AaveDIVAWrapper**: The main contract that inherits from `AaveDIVAWrapperCore` and implements the core functionality of the AaveDIVAWrapper contract (including batch versions of the core functions) as external functions. That is the contract that users interact with.
- **WToken**: The contract that represents a wrapped version of the collateral token. Deployed when the owner registers a collateral token via the [`registerCollateralToken`](#registercollateraltoken) function.

### External contracts

- [**DIVA Protocol**](https://github.com/divaprotocol/diva-protocol-v1/blob/main/addresses/addresses.json)
- [**Aave V3 Pool**][aave-docs]

For contract addresses across different networks, refer to the respective address pages of [DIVA Protocol](https://github.com/divaprotocol/diva-protocol-v1/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md#contract-addresses) and [Aave V3](https://aave.com/docs/resources/addresses). The documentation and codebases for both DIVA Protocol and Aave V3 can be found in the [Resources](#resources) section.

### Contract deployment

To deploy the `AaveDIVAWrapper` contract, the following parameters must be provided:

1. **`diva_`**: Address of the DIVA Protocol contract.
2. **`aaveV3_`**: Address of the Aave V3 contract.
3. **`owner_`**: Address of the owner of the contract, eligible to claim yield and register collateral tokens.

#### Execution steps

1. Validate that none of the provided addresses are zero.
2. Set the DIVA Protocol address (`_diva`) to the provided `diva_` address.
3. Set the Aave V3 Pool address (`_aaveV3Pool`) to the provided `aaveV3Pool_` address.
4. Initialize the `Ownable` contract with the provided `owner_` address.

#### Revert conditions

| Error                 | Condition                                                        | Contract/Library       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `ZeroAddress`         | When the DIVA Protocol or Aave V3 Pool contract address is zero. | AaveDIVAWrapper        |
| `OwnableInvalidOwner` | When the `owner_` address is zero.                               | Ownable (OpenZeppelin) |

## Owner privileges

- Register collateral tokens (token must be supported by Aave V3)
- Claim yield
- Initiate process to update owner in a 2-step process

## Upgradeability

- **AaveDIVAWrapper is immutable** and cannot be upgraded.
- **DIVA Protocol is immutable** and cannot be upgraded.
- **Aave V3 is upgradeable** and has been upgraded already multiple times in the past. The development of the AaveDIVAWrapper contract is based on [Aave V3.2](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/tree/v3.2.0). Due to AaveDIVAWrapper's reliance on only core functions (`supply()`, `withdraw()`) and the `getReserveData()` getter function, breaking changes to their interfaces are deemed unlikely. You can view the changelogs for new version releases [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-v3-origin/tree/v3.3.0/docs).

## Main user flows

The following sections provide an overview of the main user flows of the AaveDIVAWrapper contract in more technical detail.

### Pool creation / liquidity addition

The pool creation / liquidity addition flow is illustrated below:

![AaveDIVAWrapper1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d883c460-c9b0-4807-b70a-b2832e502f3f)

1. User (e.g. donor) deposits 100 USDC (the collateral token) via AaveDIVAWrapper's [`createContingentPool`](#createcontingentpool) or [`addLiquidity`](#addliquidity) function.
2. AaveDIVAWrapper supplies the 100 USDC to Aave (2a) and receives 100 rebasing aUSDC tokens (the aToken) (2b).
3. AaveDIVAWrapper mints 100 wUSDC, a wrapped version of the collateral token, and uses it as proxy collateral when creating / adding liquidity to the DIVA Protocol pool.
4. DIVA Protocol sends 100 long and 100 short tokens to the specified recipients (e.g., donor and farmer in the case of DIVA Donate).

### Position token redemption

The position token redemption flow is illustrated below. Note that for clarity, the diagram shows a simplified sequence - the actual implementation handles these steps in a slightly different order for security reasons.

![AaveDIVAWrapper Redemption Short drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc7ddabe-30bb-442e-98fe-48cca19dea24)

1. User (e.g. farmer) submits 100 short tokens for redemption to AaveDIVAWrapper via [`redeemPositionToken`](#redeempositiontoken).
2. AaveDIVAWrapper redeems 100 aUSDC from Aave (2a) and receives 100 USDC (2b). aUSDC tokens are burnt during this process.
3. AaveDIVAWrapper redeems the short tokens (3a) and receives 100 wUSDC from DIVA Protocol (3b). Short tokens are burnt during this process.
4. AaveDIVAWrapper burns 100 wTokens and transfers 100 USDC to the user.

The same redemption process applies when redeeming long tokens or when redeeming both long and short tokens simultaneously via the [`removeLiquidity`](#removeliquidity) function.

### Yield claim

The yield claim flow is as follows:

1. Owner calls the [`claimYield`](#claimyield) function to claim accrued yield.
2. AaveDIVAWrapper calculates the accrued yield by taking the excess of the aToken balance (e.g., 105) over the wToken supply (e.g., 100).
3. AaveDIVAWrapper redeems 5 aUSDC from Aave for 5 USDC and transfers them to the owner.

## Invariants

At any point in time, the following invariants have to hold true:

- `aToken balance of AaveDIVAWrapper >= wToken supply`
- `short token supply = long token supply = wToken supply`

## createContingentPool

Creates a new contingent pool in DIVA Protocol using the provided parameters. Long tokens are sent to `PoolParams.longRecipient` and short tokens to `PoolParams.shortRecipient`. The caller must approve AaveDIVAWrapper to transfer the collateral token before calling this function.

Returns the Id of the newly created pool.

```js
function createContingentPool(PoolParams calldata _poolParams) external returns (bytes32);
```

The `PoolParams` struct is defined as follows:

| `expiryTime`              | uint96  | Expiration time of the pool expressed as a unix timestamp in seconds (UTC).                                                                                                           |
| `floor`                   | uint256 | Value of the reference asset at or below which the long token pays out 0 and the short token 1 (max payout), gross of fees. Input expects an integer with 18 decimals.                |
| `inflection`              | uint256 | Value of the reference asset at which the long token pays out `gradient` and the short token `1-gradient`, gross of fees. Input expects an integer with 18 decimals.                  |
| `cap`                     | uint256 | Value of the reference asset at or above which the long token pays out 1 (max payout) and the short token 0, gross of fees. Input expects an integer with 18 decimals.                |

| `shortRecipient`          | address | Address that shall receive the short token. Any burn address except for the zero address is a valid recipient to enable conditional burn use cases.                                   |
| `permissionedERC721Token` | address | Address of the ERC721 token that transfers are restricted to. Use zero address to render the long and short tokens permissionless.                                                    |

### Execution steps

1. Verify that `PoolParams.collateralToken` is registered in the AaveDIVAWrapper contract and has an associated wToken.
1. Transfer collateral token from caller to the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
1. Supply the collateral token to Aave V3 and receive aTokens into the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
1. Mint an equivalent amount of wTokens to the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
1. Create a new contingent pool on DIVA Protocol using the provided parameters and the minted wTokens as proxy collateral. Refer to the [DIVA protocol documentation](https://github.com/divaprotocol/diva-protocol-v1/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md#createcontingentpool) for more details.
1. Send the resulting long and short tokens to the specified recipients.
1. Emit a `PoolIssued` event.
1. Return the Id of the newly created pool.

## addLiquidity

Adds `_collateralAmount` of liquidity to an existing DIVA Protocol pool identified by the provided `_poolId`. Long tokens are sent to `_longRecipient` and short tokens to `_shortRecipient`. The caller must approve AaveDIVAWrapper to transfer `_collateralAmount` of the collateral token before calling this function.

```js
function addLiquidity(
    bytes32 _poolId, // The Id of the DIVA Protocol pool to add liquidity to
    uint256 _collateralAmount, // The amount of collateral token to add as liquidity
    address _longRecipient, // The recipient of the long tokens
    address _shortRecipient // The recipient of the short tokens
) external;
```

### Execution steps

1. Verify that the collateral token used in the DIVA Protocol pool associated with `_poolId` corresponds to a registered collateral token in the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
1. Transfer the collateral token from caller to the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
1. Supply the collateral token to Aave V3 and receive aTokens.
1. Mint an equivalent amount of wTokens to the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
1. Add `_collateralAmount` of liquidity to the DIVA Protocol pool associated with the provided `_poolId` using the minted wTokens.
1. Send the resulting long and short tokens to the specified recipients.

## removeLiquidity

Removes liquidity from the pool associated with `_poolId` by burning an equal amount (`_positionTokenAmount`) of valid long and short tokens, and then transferring the corresponding collateral tokens (e.g., USDC) to the specified `_recipient`. The caller must approve AaveDIVAWrapper to transfer both long and short tokens before calling this function.

Returns the amount of collateral tokens transferred to `_recipient`, net of DIVA fees.

```js
function removeLiquidity(
    bytes32 _poolId, //  The pool Id to remove liquidity from
    uint256 _positionTokenAmount, // Amount of liquidity to remove (type(uint256).max = min short/long balance)
    address _recipient // The address of the recipient to receive the collateral tokens
) external returns (uint256);
```

### Execution steps

1. Verify that the collateral token used in the DIVA Protocol pool associated with `_poolId` corresponds to a registered collateral token in the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
1. Override `_positionTokenAmount` with the user's minimum short/long token balance if `_positionTokenAmount` equals `type(uint256).max`.
1. Transfer the specified `_positionTokenAmount` of both short and long tokens from the caller to the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
1. Remove liquidity from DIVA Protocol using the transferred short and long tokens, and get the wToken amount received.
1. Verify that `_recipient` is not the zero address.
1. Burn the wTokens (AaveDIVAWrapper contract has the authority to do so as the owner).
1. Withdraw the corresponding collateral tokens from Aave.
1. Transfer the withdrawn collateral tokens to the specified `_recipient`.
1. Return the amount transferred.

### Additional notes

- **DIVA fees**: The DIVA fee charged on the removal of liquidity is denominated in wToken (the pool's collateral token) and is withheld within DIVA Protocol, where it can be claimed by the respective owner. The wToken can then be converted into the underlying asset (e.g., USDC) via AaveDIVAWrapper's [`redeemWToken`](#redeemwtoken) function.

## redeemPositionToken

Redeems `_positionTokenAmount` of `_positionToken` (short or long token) for the collateral token (e.g., USDC) and transfers it to the specified `_recipient`. The caller must approve AaveDIVAWrapper to transfer the position tokens before calling this function.

Returns the amount of collateral tokens transferred to `_recipient`, net of DIVA fees.

```js
function redeemPositionToken(
    address _positionToken, // The address of the position token to redeem
    uint256 _positionTokenAmount, // Amount to redeem (type(uint256).max = caller's balance)
    address _recipient // The recipient of the returned collateral tokens
) external returns (uint256);
```

### Execution steps

1. Verify that the pool's collateral token is associated with a registered wToken in the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
1. Override `_positionTokenAmount` with the user's position token balance if `_positionTokenAmount` equals `type(uint256).max`.
1. Transfer the specified amount of position tokens from the caller to the AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
1. Redeem the position token on DIVA Protocol and get the wToken amount received.
1. Verify that `_recipient` is not the zero address.
1. Burn the wTokens (AaveDIVAWrapper contract has the authority to do so as the owner).
1. Withdraw the corresponding collateral tokens from Aave.
1. Transfer the withdrawn collateral tokens to the specified recipient.
1. Return the amount transferred.

### Additional notes

- **DIVA fees**: The DIVA fee charged on redemptionis denominated in wToken and is withheld within DIVA Protocol, where it can be claimed by the respective DIVA Protocol owner. The wToken can be converted via AaveDIVAWrapper's [`redeemWToken`](#redeemwtoken) function into the underlying asset (e.g., USDC).

## redeemWToken

Converts the provided `_wTokenAmount` of `_wToken` into the underlying collateral token and transfers it to the specified `_recipient`. Users that received wTokens, e.g., by redeeming their position tokens directly from DIVA Protocol or other direct interactions, can use this function to convert them into collateral tokens (e.g., USDC). No prior approval from the caller is required for this operation as the AaveDIVAWrapper contract has the authority to burn wTokens directly from the caller's balance.

Returns the amount of collateral tokens withdrawn from Aave and transferred to `_recipient`.

```js
function redeemWToken(
    address _wToken, // The address of the wToken to convert
    uint256 _wTokenAmount, // Amount to convert (type(uint256).max = caller's balance)
    address _recipient // The address of the recipient to receive the collateral tokens
) external returns (uint256);
```

### Execution steps

1. Use the user's balance if `_wTokenAmount` equals `type(uint256).max`.
1. Burn the specified amount of wTokens from the caller's balance.
1. Withdraw the corresponding amount of collateral tokens from Aave.
1. Transfer the withdrawn collateral tokens to the specified `_recipient`.
1. Return the amount transferred.

## registerCollateralToken

Registers a new `_collateralToken` and returns the address of the corresponding wToken. Only callable by the owner.

Returns the address of the newly created wToken.

```js
function registerCollateralToken(address _collateralToken) external returns (address);
```

### Execution steps

1. Verify that the provided `_collateralToken` is not yet registered.
1. Confirm that the provided `_collateralToken` is supported by Aave V3.
1. Deploy a new wToken contract to represent the wrapped version of the provided `_collateralToken`:
   - Set the symbol as "w" + `_collateralToken` symbol (e.g., wUSDT).
   - Set decimals to match the `_collateralToken`.
   - Set the AaveDIVAWrapper contract as the owner of the wToken.
1. Map the `_collateralToken` address to the newly created wToken address, and vice versa for reverse lookups.
1. Approve unlimited wToken transfers to DIVA Protocol.
1. Approve unlimited `_collateralToken` transfers to Aave V3.
1. Emit a `CollateralTokenRegistered` event.
1. Return the address of the newly created wToken.

### Additional notes

- **Token decimals**: wToken, aToken and collateral token have the same number of decimals.
- **wToken ownership**: The AaveDIVAWrapper contract is set as the owner of the wToken and has exclusive rights to mint and burn them.
- **Unlimited approvals**: The unlimited approvals are deemed safe as the `AaveDIVAWrapper` is a pass-through entity that does not hold excess wTokens or collateral tokens. Should a vulnerability be discovered in DIVA Protocol or Aave, users can simply stop interacting with the `AaveDIVAWrapper` contract.
- **Allowance behavior**: Granting an infinite allowance for wToken does not reduce the allowance on `transferFrom` as it uses a newer OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation. However, this behavior may differ for collateral tokens like USDC, DAI, or WETH used in Aave. These tokens decrement the allowance with each use of `transferFrom`, even if an unlimited allowance is set. Consequently, though very unlikely, AaveDIVAWrapper could eventually exhaust its allowance. The [`approveCollateralTokenForAave`](#approvecollateraltokenforaave) function has been implemented to manually reset the allowance for Aave to unlimited.

## claimYield

Transfers the yield accrued in the provided `_collateralToken` to the specified `_recipient`. Only callable by the owner of the contract. Partial yield claims are not supported.

Returns the amount of collateral token sent to `_recipient`.

```js
function claimYield(
    address _collateralToken, // The address of the collateral token to claim yield for
    address _recipient // The address of the recipient to whom the accrued yield will be transferred
) external returns (uint256);
```

### Execution steps

1. Verify that the caller is the contract owner (enforced by `onlyOwner` modifier).
1. Verify that the provided `_collateralToken` is registered.
1. Verify that the provided `_recipient` is not the zero address.
1. Calculate the accrued yield for the provided `_collateralToken` (AaveDIVAWrapper contract's aToken balance - wToken supply).
1. Withdraw the accrued yield from Aave V3.
1. Transfer the withdrawn collateral token amount to the specified recipient.
1. Emit a `YieldClaimed` event.
1. Return the amount claimed.

### Additional notes

- **Yield calculation**: The accrued yield is calculated as the difference between the AaveDIVAWrapper contract's aToken balance and the total supply of the associated wToken. If the aToken balance is smaller than the wToken supply (e.g., due to rounding), the function will revert with error code 26 from Aave V3. In this case, the owner should wait for more yield to accrue.

## approveCollateralTokenForAave

Resets the allowance of the provided `_collateralToken` for the Aave V3 contract to unlimited, should it ever be depleted. Can be triggered by anyone. Using OpenZeppelin's `safeIncreaseAllowance` to accommodate tokens like USDT on Ethereum that require the approval to be set to zero before setting it to a non-zero value.

```js
function approveCollateralTokenForAave(address _collateralToken) external;
```

### Execution steps

1. Verify that the provided `_collateralToken` is registered in AaveDIVAWrapper contract.
1. Retrieve the current allowance of AaveDIVAWrapper contract for the `_collateralToken` on Aave V3.
1. Calculate the difference between the maximum possible allowance and the current allowance.
1. Increase the allowance by this difference.

## Miscellaneous

- This contract does not implement `receive` or `fallback` functions and, therefore, cannot accept Ether directly through plain transactions or manage calls to non-existent functions.
- This contract does not support deposits in Ether. To support Ether deposits, an adapter contract like [this one](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-periphery/blob/master/contracts/misc/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol) can be placed in front.

## Risk disclaimer

The use of any DeFi protocol comes with certain risks. Be responsible when interacting with the AaveDIVAWrapper contract and don't put in more funds than you are willing to lose. By interacting with AaveDIVAWrapper you acknowledge the following risks:

- **Smart contract risk**: Despite following best practices in Solidity coding and conducting a smart contract audit, bugs cannot be fully excluded. Only deposit amounts that you can afford to lose.
- **Integration risk**: The AaveDIVAWrapper contract integrates with Aave V3 and DIVA Protocol. Vulnerabilities or issues in either protocol (e.g., bad debt in Aave) may affect the functionality of AaveDIVAWrapper.
- **Upgradeability of Aave V3**: Aave V3's upgradeable nature may introduce breaking changes in future versions which could impact the functionality of the AaveDIVAWrapper contract. However, this risk is deemed low as the AaveDIVAWrapper contract only uses a limited number of Aave's core functions which are unlikely to see breaking changes (see [Upgradeability section](#upgradeability)).
